# ConfigLang

ConfigLang is a highly customizable programming language that allows you to create your own syntax and change your language's file extension with no code required using a single config file.

## Customizable

So customizable that you can...

1. **Create Your Own Syntax**: Define your own rules and structure for your programming language. This allows you to create a language that suits your specific needs or preferences.

2. **Change Your Language's File Extension**: You're not stuck with a `.py` or `.js` file extension. With ConfigLang, you can define your own file extension for your custom language.

... with no code!

## Extra Features

1. **Loading Libraries from Python**: ConfigLang can import and use Python libraries. This means you can leverage the vast ecosystem of Python libraries in your custom language.

2. **Default Configurations**: To avoid configuration errors and make the language user-friendly, ConfigLang comes with a set of default configurations. These can be easily modified to suit your needs.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: ConfigLang includes robust error handling with custom exceptions for unknown variables, functions, and libraries, as well as syntax errors. This makes debugging easier and the language more reliable.
